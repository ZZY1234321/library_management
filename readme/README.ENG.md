## I. Project Overview

This project is the coursework for the Database Course Design in the second semester of the 2023 - 2024 academic year at CUPB. It uses Python + SQL to build an integrated front-end and back-end library management system, providing an efficient digital solution for the daily operation and resource management of libraries.

 

## II. Functional Features

### (I) Book Management

\- **Accurate Input and Modification**: Carefully enter key information such as book names, authors, publishers, publication years, ISBNs, and inventories to ensure the integrity and accuracy of book data. Meanwhile, book details can be flexibly modified to update the book status and information in real time.

\- **Intelligent Retrieval and Filtering**: Quickly retrieve books based on multiple dimensions such as book titles, authors, and ISBNs, and support precise filtering by categories and publication year ranges, helping administrators quickly locate target books.

 

### (II) Reader Management

\- **Information Registration and Maintenance**: Comprehensively register basic information of readers, including names, genders, ages, contact information, and library card numbers, facilitating the update of reader information to ensure the timeliness and accuracy of data.

\- **Borrowing History Tracking**: Clearly record the historical records of readers borrowing books, including book names, borrowing dates, return dates, and overdue situations, providing strong data support for borrowing management and reader services.

 

### (III) Optimization of the Borrowing and Returning Process

\- **Convenient Borrowing Operations**: Administrators can quickly handle book borrowing based on readers' library card numbers and book ISBNs, automatically update the book inventory and readers' borrowing status, and record the borrowing date in real time to start a seamless borrowing process.

\- **Intelligent Return Processing**: When returning books, the system accurately checks the book information based on the ISBN, automatically checks the overdue status and calculates fines (if any), and updates the book inventory and readers' borrowing records according to the actual situation to ensure efficient and transparent book circulation.

 

### (IV) Inventory Monitoring and Warning

\- **Real-time Inventory Insight**: Present the inventory quantity of each book in real time and visually display the dynamic changes of the inventory, providing immediate data support for procurement decisions.

\- **Intelligent Warning Mechanism**: When the inventory approaches the preset threshold, the system automatically triggers a warning to promptly remind administrators to replenish stocks, avoiding the impact of book shortages on readers' borrowing experiences.

 

## III. Technical Architecture

### (I) Front-end Development

\- **HTML5 + CSS3 Collaborative Layout**: Use HTML5 to build a solid page structure, and CSS3 to carefully design styles, creating a beautiful, comfortable, and user-friendly interface to ensure a consistent browsing experience across platforms.

\- **JavaScript Interaction Empowerment**: Introduce JavaScript to inject interactive vitality into the page, realizing functions such as form validation, dynamic data loading, and menu interaction, improving the smoothness and convenience of user operations.

 

### (II) Back-end Development

\- **Python as the Core Driver**: Rely on Python's powerful programming capabilities to write efficient business logic code, implement the core functional modules of the system, and ensure the stable and reliable operation and excellent performance of the system.

\- **SQL Database Interaction**: Interact closely with the database by using SQL statements, carefully design multiple table structures such as book tables, reader tables, and borrowing record tables, and realize efficient data access and management through complex query, update, and insert operations.

 

### (III) Database Selection

\- **MySQL for Robust Support**: Choose the MySQL database, relying on its mature stability, high concurrent processing ability, and rich functional features to provide a solid underlying architecture for the system's massive data storage, rapid retrieval, and complex association queries.

 

## IV. File Structure Description

\- **`.idea`**: A directory dedicated to the configuration files of the integrated development environment (IDE), storing project-specific settings and metadata to help accurately configure the development environment.

\- **`__pycache__`**: A folder for caching Python bytecode, storing bytecode files generated by compilation to optimize the efficiency of code reloading and improve the system's running performance.

\- **`models`**: The core area for defining data models, encapsulating the database table structures and operation logics, realizing data interaction in an object-oriented programming style, and improving the modularity and maintainability of the code.

\- **`static/css`**: A collection place for static resource CSS style sheets, centrally managing page layout and style design files to ensure unified style modification and efficient maintenance.

\- **`templates`**: A repository for storing HTML template files, using template engine technology to achieve dynamic page rendering, separating data and display logic, and enhancing the readability and reusability of the code.

\- **`README.md`**: The project documentation that you are currently reading, providing comprehensive guidance and technical explanations for developers and users.

\- **`app.py`**: The main entry file for the back-end Flask application, coordinating route definition, request processing and distribution, and application startup configuration to build the overall running framework of the system.

\- **`mysqlUtils.py`**: A module for MySQL database operation tools, encapsulating common functions such as database connection establishment, query execution, and transaction processing, simplifying the writing of database interaction code and improving the reusability and testability of the code.

 

## V. Installation and Deployment Guide

### (I) Environment Preparation

\- Install the official version of Python 3.6 and ensure that the pip package manager runs normally to lay a solid foundation for installing project dependencies.

\- Download and install the community version of the MySQL database, complete the basic configuration according to the official documentation, and enable remote access permissions to ensure the stable startup and monitoring of the database service.

 

### (II) Project Cloning and Dependency Installation

1. Clone this project repository to the local development directory: `git clone https://github.com/ZZY1234321/library_management.git`
2. The `library_management\venv\Lib\site-packages` directory includes all the core dependency libraries required by this project, and the project environment is complete.

 

### (III) Database Configuration and Initialization

1. Modify the database connection parameters in the `mysqlUtils.py` file according to the actual environment configuration to accurately point to the local or remote MySQL database instance.
2. Execute the database initialization scripts (such as SQL files) provided by the project to create necessary data tables and initial data, or use the built-in database migration tools in the Flask application (such as Flask-Migrate) to create and update the database schema according to the model definitions to build a solid data storage framework.

 

### (IV) Application Startup

Execute the startup command in the project root directory: `python app.py`. The Flask application will listen to the local port 5000 by default (configurable). Access `http://localhost:5000` in the browser to start the journey of using the library management system.

 

## VI. Contribution Guide

Welcome developers to contribute their wisdom and strength to this project! If you expect to participate in contributions, please follow the following process:

1. **Fork this project repository**: Create a personal branch of the project on the GitHub platform to start an independent development journey.
2. **Clone the forked repository to local**: `git clone [your repository URL]`, pull the remote code repository to the local development environment to build a working copy.
3. **Create a feature branch**: Create an independent feature development branch based on the `master` branch, such as `feature/[branch name]`, to ensure the isolation of feature development and avoid interfering with the main code flow.
